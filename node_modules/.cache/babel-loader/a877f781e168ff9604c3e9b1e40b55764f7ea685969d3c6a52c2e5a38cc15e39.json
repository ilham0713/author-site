Her first trip abroad was at the middle-school age of eleven when her family visited England, France and Spain. She learned the difficulties and the emotional challenges of being in a new place.  She had to navigate conversations in different languages for simple tasks like selecting food, making a purchase or making a friend.  She learned the value of laughter and humor, which you will find in her travel adventure stories. After high school she traveled to Mexico where she lived for six years. Eventually, she moved to New York City where she became a teacher of Spanish and English as a Second Language to high school students and adults. In New York City she taught students who represented many cultures, mostly from Latin America. In the series you will travel with Miranda, a middle-schooler who speaks limited Spanish.  She is happy to explore parts of Latin America and make new friends. Stay with her as she takes you through the beauty of these countries where cultures collided centuries ago to create a new and authentic one.
